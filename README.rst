Glue OpenSpace plugin
====================================

An experimental plugin was developed as part of the *Astrographics: Interactive Data-Driven Journeys through Space* workshop at Dagstuhl. This repository is forked from the repository https://github.com/aniisabihi/glue-openspace-thesis, which in turn is forked from the original repository at https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-openspace,

2020: Two master thesis students for OpenSpace, Aniisa Bihi & Johanna Granstr√∂m, developed a message protocol for OpenSpace that can connect OpenSpace to other software. This plugin was developed further at the same time so that the messaging could be tested.

2022: Two master thesis students for OpenSpace, Jacob Molin & Victor Lindquist, are continuing the previous work by extending the Glue-OpenSpace integration.

To try it out::

    pip install git+https://github.com/openspace/glue-openspace.git
    
    Requires that the developer's version of OpenSpace is installed from the branch called 'Software Integration'
