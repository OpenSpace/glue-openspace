Glue OpenSpace plugin
====================================

An experimental plugin was developed as part of the *Astrographics: Interactive Data-Driven Journeys through Space* workshop at Dagstuhl. This repository is forked from the original repository at: https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-openspace

Two master thesis students for OpenSpace, Aniisa Bihi & Johanna Granstr√∂m, developed a message protocol for OpenSpace that can connect OpenSpace to other software. This plugin was developed further at the same time so that the messaging could be tested.

To try it out::

    pip install git+https://github.com/aniisabihi/glue-openspace-thesis.git
    
    Requires that the developer's version of OpenSpace is installed from the branch called 'Software Integration'
