Glue OpenSpace plugin
====================================

An experimental plugin was developed as part of the *Astrographics: Interactive Data-Driven Journeys through Space* workshop at Dagstuhl. This repository is forked from the original repository at: https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-openspace

Two master thesis students, Aniisa Bihi & Johann Granstr√∂m, for OpenSpace are in the process of developing a message protocol for OpenSpace that can connect OpenSpace to other software. This plugin is begin developed further at the same time so that the messaging can be tested. 

To try it out::

    pip install git+https://github.com/aniisabihi/glue-openspace-thesis.git
    
    Requires that the developer's version of OpenSpace is installed from the branch called 'Software Integration'
